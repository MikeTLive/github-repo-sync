# github-repo-sync

## Why?

Currently Github does not have a simple, straightforward way to automatically sync a fork with the original repo.

## Use

Just copy the `repo-sync.sh` file to your fork and run it `repo-sync.sh ORIGINAL_FORK_URL`. Or if you are impatient `curl -L http://bit.ly/repo-sync | bash -s ORIGINAL_FORK_URL`.

Now you can push your changes
